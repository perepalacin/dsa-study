1. Backtracking (Easy):
Concept: As discussed before, this is the fundamental brute-force approach. It tries each possible digit (1-9) in empty cells, and if a placement violates the Sudoku rules, it backtracks and tries a different digit.
Why it's interesting: It's the baseline algorithm that guarantees a solution (if one exists) and is relatively straightforward to understand and implement. It clearly demonstrates the "trial and error" approach.

2. Constraint Propagation with Naked/Hidden Singles (Easy to Medium):
Concept: This builds upon the idea of maintaining a set of possible candidate numbers for each empty cell.
Naked Singles: If a cell has only one remaining candidate, that's the solution for that cell.
Hidden Singles: Within a row, column, or block, if a number is a candidate in only one cell, then that cell must hold that number.
Why it's interesting: It introduces the concept of logical deduction and is more efficient than pure backtracking for many easy to medium puzzles. It mimics a basic human solving strategy.

3. Constraint Propagation with Naked/Hidden Pairs and Triples (Medium):
Concept: Extends the previous constraint propagation techniques to consider groups of cells.
Naked Pairs/Triples: If two/three cells in a row, column, or block have the exact same two/three candidate numbers, those numbers can be eliminated as candidates from other cells in that unit.
Hidden Pairs/Triples: If two/three candidate numbers appear in only two/three specific cells within a row, column, or block, then those cells cannot contain any other candidates.
Why it's interesting: It demonstrates more advanced logical deduction and significantly reduces the search space compared to just singles. Implementing the logic to identify these patterns adds a layer of complexity.

4. Backtracking with Forward Checking and Heuristics (Medium to Hard):
Concept: This enhances the backtracking algorithm with techniques to prune the search space more effectively:
Forward Checking: After placing a digit in a cell, update the candidate lists of related empty cells by removing the placed digit as a possibility. If any cell's candidate list becomes empty, it indicates a dead end, and the algorithm backtracks.
Heuristics: Implement strategies for selecting the next empty cell to try. A common heuristic is to choose the cell with the fewest remaining candidate numbers (Minimum Remaining Values - MRV), often combined with Degree Heuristic (choosing the cell that constrains the most unassigned neighbors).
Why it's interesting: It shows how informed choices within a backtracking framework can dramatically improve performance. Implementing the candidate tracking and heuristic selection adds algorithmic depth.

5. Constraint Propagation with Advanced Techniques (Hard):
Concept: Incorporating more sophisticated logical deduction patterns like:
X-Wings: A specific pattern across two rows (or columns) involving two candidate numbers.
Y-Wings (XY-Wings): A chain of three cells with specific candidate relationships.
Swordfish, Jellyfish, Skyscraper: More complex patterns for eliminating candidates.
Forcing Chains: Temporarily assuming a value and tracing the logical consequences to deduce the correct value.
Why it's interesting: These techniques are often required to solve very difficult Sudoku puzzles and demonstrate a deeper understanding of constraint satisfaction. Implementing these algorithms involves recognizing complex patterns and applying intricate logical rules.
